The app wrapper script will be auto-generated and placed in this folder. 

Other app dependencies, such as scripts, binaries, or containers may also be placed in this folder. Binaries and containers may also be specified in the config.yaml file and built or copied to this folder when the app is built with the "make-app" GeneFlow command.
